# IoP Lab Assignments

This project is a collection of code written for the assignments in lab of the subject IoP(Introduction of Programming) in the first semester of my B.Tech degree in Artificial Intelligence at SVNIT College.

This project is for Dr. Praveen Kumar Chandaliya, our professor of IoP subject, as well as the other professor's and TA's responsible, for future use or for anyone curious in the beginning of my C programming journey.


## Features

The questions of lab are given in the pdf titled 'IoP Lab'. This can be used to understand which code is in reference to which question.
Includes Assignment 1 and 2 in seperate files.
The code has been compiled by MinGW compiler, written in notepad and executed on Command Prompt.
To execute the file, we must simply:  
1) Type 'cd' then paste the address of where our source file is located. Press Enter.
2) Type 'gcc' then enter the name of source file. Press Enter.  
3) The file is compiled and saved in a file titled 'a.exe'. Enter 'a'.  
4) The program will then be run.

## Demo

There is an image titled 'Demo.png' in the folder which shows the basic layout of executing the program
